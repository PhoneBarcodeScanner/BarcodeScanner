# PhoneBarcodeScanner
TimberSmart PhoneBarcodeScanner:

This is a Phone Barcode Scanning app which talks to TimberSmart's inventory management system.
This app will allow users to scan barcodes using a mid-range Android device - saving the data in a local database.
This will allow TimberSmart to target small-scale businesses, providing a cheaper alternative to the Drone Scanner App but with the same features. 
This is the first iteration of the app created in Semester 2, 2021.
