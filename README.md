TimberSmart DroneBarcodeScanner
This is a Drone Barcode Scanning app which talks to TimberSmart's inventory management system.
The drone barcode scanner app will be connected to a DJI drone to fly and scan timber barcodes that could be several meters off the ground and out of reach.
This will help TimberSmart's clients in various ways.
This is the second development cycle of this app developed in Semester 1, 2021.
